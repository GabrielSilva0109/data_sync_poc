# 📋 Data Sync PoC - Project Description (English)

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Data Sync PoC** is a **modern event-driven microservices architecture** that demonstrates real-time data synchronization patterns using AWS cloud-native services. This Proof of Concept showcases how to build scalable, resilient systems for enterprise-grade data processing and distribution.

## 🚀 What Does This Project Do?

This system captures business events (like user registrations) through a REST API and automatically distributes them across multiple downstream systems using AWS EventBridge, Lambda, and SQS - enabling **loose coupling**, **horizontal scaling**, and **fault tolerance**.

### **Core Workflow:**
1. **📱 Client** sends user data via REST API
2. **🌐 User Service** validates and accepts the request
3. **📡 EventBridge** routes events to multiple consumers
4. **⚡ Lambda** processes events asynchronously
5. **📬 SQS** queues messages for reliable processing
6. **🔄 Consumers** handle final business logic

## 💡 Business Value Proposition

### **Problem Solved:**
- ❌ **Tight coupling** between systems
- ❌ **Synchronous processing** bottlenecks
- ❌ **Single points of failure**
- ❌ **Manual data synchronization**
- ❌ **Poor scalability** and maintainability

### **Solution Benefits:**
- ✅ **Decoupled architecture** - systems can evolve independently
- ✅ **Asynchronous processing** - improved user experience
- ✅ **Automatic scaling** - handles traffic spikes efficiently
- ✅ **Fault tolerance** - automatic retry and error handling
- ✅ **Event sourcing** - complete audit trail
- ✅ **Multi-cloud ready** - portable across cloud providers
